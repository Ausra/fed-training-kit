# About This Kit

Welcome to the FED Guild Training Kit!

This kit is an assembly of online training references for the purpose of self-learning and practicing some core tools and methodologies used in the guild, that every new engineer should know.

True, there is an abundance of materials online, but only some are actually helpful and put in context. The topics below organize the best of them to provide a step-by-step learning experience, followed by hands-on exercises. Feel free to skip and skim the materials as you like.

Enjoy! We would appreciate your [feedback](mailto:academy@wix.com).

* [Maya Alon](mailto:mayaa@wix.com), Head of Wix Academy

* [Lee Baror](mailto:lee.avzuk@gmail.com), Content Developer

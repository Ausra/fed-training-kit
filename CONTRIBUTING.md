# Contributing to FED Training

This repo contains material of general purpose. So before you propose a topic, ask yourself - `is it generic enough that every FED should learn it?`

If you answer is `yes`, following the step:

1. Create a new folder with content under `src` folder.
1. Specify the `goals`, `topics`, `exercise` and `resources` sections.
1. Make a PR.
1. Review.

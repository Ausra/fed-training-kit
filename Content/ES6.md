# What is ECMAScript6?

[ECMAScript 6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-ecmascript-overview), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009.

# Learn

  With every new spec release from ECMA, code developing becomes a little easier. 
  Many things that we are already used to (such as regular expressions and `tryCatch`) have been released in previous ECMAScript versions.
  
  So you can see how this new functionality and features will affect your daily work. Code that you have written before (and even the way you think in order to comply with JavaScript's constraints) will become shorter, more readable and easier to implement. 
  Features that you had in other languages and were missing in JS will become available. Great ideas that developers came up with over the years are now integrated into the language for everyone to use.
  
  In a few years, this release will also be taken for granted, so the sooner you learn ES6 the sooner you can use it as a second nature.

  Watch this guy John Paul, with a clear passion for the language, running through ES6 introduced features.
  
  
There's a world of difference between learning new syntax, and truly understanding it, the full span of what you can do with it and where its power truly lies. 
To that end, we've assembled a few in depth overviews of some of ES6 major features, introduced in the standard. 
Take your time with diving into one, more or all of them.


- **[Arrow Functions](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/09/10/understanding-ecmascript-6-arrow-functions/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Learn the variations of arrow function syntax and in what arrow functions differ from regular JS functions.
  
- **[Classes](http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-classes-final.html)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  This blog post explains how classes' final incarnation works. The most significant recent changes were related to how subclassing is handled. You can skip sections 1 and 2 if you know ES6 class essentials. 

- **[Destructuring](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/getting-started-with-javascript-es6-destructuring/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  This post explains how destructuring of arrays, objects and function arguments can help with more explicit variable and argument declaration and assignment. 
  
- **[Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  At first glance, having modules built into ECMAScript 6 may seem like a boring feature. But ES6 modules have features that you can’t add via a library, such as a very compact syntax and a static module structure (which helps with optimizations, static checking and more). They will also – hopefully – end the fragmentation between the currently dominant standards CommonJS and AMD.
  
- **[Promises](http://www.datchley.name/es6-promises/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  This post explains how to create a promise and why promises give us much more than just an escape from callback hell.
  

So, can I start using ES6?
The majority of browsers [are catching up](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) on implementing new ES6 features but not one has full support. 
Using transpilers in the last couple of years has become the norm. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is an ES6 to ES5 transpiler that supports all of the ES6 features.


# Practice

- [ ] **Write the Beer Song with ES6** <a href="#"><img src="/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="/assets/tag-handson.png"></img></a>     
  Write a class `BeerSong` using ES6 that generates the Beer Song (i.e., “99 bottles of beer on the wall…”). Solution example code [here](http://gwmccull.github.io/2015/06/05/exercism-beer-song-es6/).
  You can use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to experiment in it too.

  [This kata assembly](http://es6katas.org/) covers all of the topics, relatively advanced. Requires understanding of basic testing principles.

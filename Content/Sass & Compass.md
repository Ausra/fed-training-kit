# What is Sass and Compass?

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets), is a stylesheet CSS extension language. 
It basically provides you some cool features that you’ve always wanted CSS to have 
like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies. You can see SASS as an enhanced version of CSS. 

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is an open source CSS authoring framework that makes your stylesheets and markup easier to build and maintain. With Compass, you write your stylesheets with Sass instead of CSS.

# Learn

SASS is a simple and easy language, so simple that it can be learned in half an hour. So let's start with that.
  
- **[The Official SASS Guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Explains the basics: 
  - Nesting
  - Variables (`$some-variable`)
  - Partials (`_partial-file.scss`)
  - Import (`@import _partial-file.scss`)
  - Mixins (`@mixin my-mixin() {}` / `@inlcude my-mixin()`)
  - Inheritance (`@extend`) 
  - Operators (`font-size: 5px * 3`) <br></br>

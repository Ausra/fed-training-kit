# What is JSX?

By now you have probably experimented in creating a component or two in the DOM, using `React.createElement`.
But if you need more components than that, it can get a little messy to track all those elements in React's structured functions tree.
There must be an easier, more readable way to do this. The easier way is using JSX.

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) stands for JavaScript as XML, so you will be using XML-like syntax inside your Javascript.

# Learn

React JSX transforms from an XML-like syntax into native JavaScript.
XML elements, attributes and children are transformed into arguments that are passed to `React.createElement`.

###Tips

If you know all the properties that you want to place on a component ahead of time, great. But if you don't use this:

JSX looks like HTML but there are some important differences you may run into.

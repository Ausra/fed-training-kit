# What are Chrome DevTools?
[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools), bundled and available in Chrome and Safari, allow web developers and programmers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application.

These amazing tools can help you debug your JavaScript code and CSS. But it is not only that. 
They can also speed up your development time and help you improve your code's performance in ways you didn't expect.

# Learn


You may not realize it but your browser is one of the best and most instrumented development platforms. 

- **[Explore and Master Chrome DevTools]( http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/)**   <a href="#"><img src="/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"> <img src="/assets/tag-video.png"></img></a> <img src="/assets/tag-handson.png"></img></a>      
Code school has a very good tutorial with videos and challenges. Total video time is 45 min, divided in to a bunch of short 2-5 min videos according to topic. They also have around 50 exercises.

- **[15 Must-Know Tips & Tricks]( http://tutorialzine.com/2015/03/15-must-know-chrome-devtools-tips-tricks/)**   <a href="#"><img src="/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>          
Leaving popular features (live-editing CSS, using the console and the debugger) aside, these small yet so helpful tips will improve and shorten your workflow with the tool.

A demonstration of insights gained from working with DevTools in a way that you might not have been aware of. 

# Practice

Fun exercises to show different aspects of the chrome developer tools. Pass each exercise by finding errors in the code and fixing them right inside the dev tools. 
# Extras

- **[Google Videos](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/videos)**   
Google has a pretty nice set of videos, 20 min of short introduction videos, and 3 big videos from the google I/O conferences that include all the new hidden features of the dev tools.  

- **[Shortcuts](http://anti-code.com/devtools-cheatsheet/)**   
  A cheat sheet worth bookmarking for keyboard shortcuts in panels and more.
  
- **[What's New](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/)**   
  Worth an occasional check for new stuff.

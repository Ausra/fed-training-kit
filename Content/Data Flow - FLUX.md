# Learn

React Implements a Unidirectional Data Flow Called Flux.
There are many ways to implement Flux, as long as they are unidirectional and implement the following, they're fine.

[Intro to Flux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw#t=10m10s) - Watch Jing Chen's part (till minute 24).


To implement Flux follow these 4 categories:

1.	**Actions & Action Creators**

    <img src="/assets/Actions.png" height="185" width="565"></img>

  - Upon new data (a user interacting with the application or through a web API), an *action* is invoked.
  - An action is an object literal containing the new fields of data and a specific action type.

2.	**The Dispatcher**

  <img src="/assets/Dispatcher.png" height="185" width="565"></img>

  - A centralized hub that creates a bridge between your app and the Store. A registry of callbacks, registered by stores.
  - When new data comes in, the dispatcher uses these callbacks to propagate that data to all of the stores.
  - Can invoke callbacks in order.
  - API: register() and dispatch().

3.	**Stores**

    <img src="/assets/Stores.png" height="225" width="565"></img>

  - Hold data & application logic for a logical domain.
  - Control and update themselves. Public interface: only getters.
  - Stores decide if and how they should respond to the callback. When they update, they emit a change event.

4.	**Views (Controller)** 	

    <img src="/assets/Views.png" height="185" width="565"></img>

  - We need a React component near the top of our component hierarchy to listen for changes broadcasted by stores.
  - When it receives a change event from the store, it requests the new data and passes and calls its own setState() method, causing its render() and all its descendantsâ€™ render() to run.

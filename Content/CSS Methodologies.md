# What are CSS methodologies?

[OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/book/) are the 3 main CSS methodologies for scalable maintainable frontend code.
They protect us from spaghetti code and improve our CSS code readability, so our code doesn't suck.

# Learn

  Writing CSS is really simple, we’ve been doing it for many years. 
  But the problem is, that as our project scales up, our CSS code becomes really unwieldy and handling it becomes hard. Really hard.
  It gets harder to maintain, harder to debug and unoptimized lines of code lead to poor performance. 
  And guess what? Someone is going to use your code to do something with it. 
  They may hesitate to use it, so they'll write new classes, IDs, etc. which will lead to redundancy and (surprise!) to unoptimized code. 
  
  Smart people across the world have tried to solve these painful points by working on various solutions like pre-processors, standards, methodologies, etc. 
  In this topic we’ll just take a look at some of the famous methodologies employed by a lot of professional front end engineers. 

**OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS)**  
Probably the most famous moethodology. 
First on, OOCSS may be a misleading name. It implies ideas and behaviours that simply don’t exist in CSS. What it is, is this: 
The core idea is to seperate structure and skin, content and container to be able to change them at will and create a frontend framework with re-usable components.

- **[Intro to OOCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKFq2cSbQ4Q&feature=youtu.be&t=2m59s)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-5m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-video.png"></img></a>   
  Watch until minute 8.40. Gives great introduction of how to apply the object oriented approach to your web components.

  This post focuses on concepts that help acheive the main goal of the methodology. 
  
  
**BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)**  
BEM is a smart naming convension that give your CSS classes more transparency and meaning to other developers.


- **[Intro to BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  This is a good intro to BEM syntax, why we shouldn't care it looks ugly and most importantly - when not to use it.
  
- **[Why We Should Consider BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-5m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/ng-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Read the ”Why should we consider BEM?” chapter in order to understand the motivation behind the methodology.

**SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)**  
SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. 
It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.
